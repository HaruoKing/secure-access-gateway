# JWT Configuration
# Required environment variables for JWT validation

# Expected issuer (iss) claim in JWT tokens
JWT_ISSUER=https://your-auth-provider.com

# Expected audience (aud) claim in JWT tokens
JWT_AUDIENCE=secure-access-gateway

# JWT signing key (HMAC-SHA256 secret key)
# In production, this should be a strong, randomly generated secret
# For testing, you can use any string
JWT_SIGNING_KEY=your-secret-key-here

# Scope-Based Authorization
# The gateway enforces scope-based authorization on protected endpoints:
#
# GET    /api/data   → Requires "data:read" scope
# POST   /api/data   → Requires "data:write" scope
# DELETE /api/data   → Requires "admin" scope
#
# JWT tokens must include a "scope" claim with space-separated scopes.
# Example: "scope": "data:read data:write admin"
